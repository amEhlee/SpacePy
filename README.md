# SpacePy

**Current Version v0.0.2.2** - [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

This was a quick project made by myself in late 2017-2018. The project was started in order to have a greater understanding of python and now has been repurposed to help myself in learning python and GIT

The game is a quick Text Based RPG run off terminal where you play as a stranded astronaut looking for a way off your collapsing spaceship.

Since this project is just meant to help myself learn git there isnt much to see here. Feel free to look through the code otherwise and overall just enjoy! üêô
