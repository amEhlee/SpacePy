# VERTIGE

**Current Version v0.0.2.2** - [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

This was a quick project made by myself in late 2017-2018. The project was started in order to have a greater understanding of python and now has been repurposed to help myself in learning python and GIT

The game is a quick Text Based RPG run off terminal where you play as a stranded astronaut looking for a way off your collapsing spaceship.

Since this project is just meant to help myself learn git there isnt much to see here. Feel free to look through the code otherwise and overall just enjoy! 🐙

# HOW TO GET IT RUNNING 
    1. Navigate in terminal to where you have saved the downloaded SpacePy Folder or Pref use an ide like vscode
    2. Your location should look something like this "C:\Users\userX\Downloads\Vertige>"
    3. From here in terminal type in "python3 ./Game/main.py" or if you're using an ide run the main.py file
    4. Congrats you should be runnning it now!

# NOTES 
    This is by no means a finished project! As stated before this is just to help me relearn some of the intricacies of python and 
    development using git in general. As a result this prolly looks SOOOOOOOOOO a$@ so any criticism is greatly appreciated. 
    First release is probably soon but feel free to take this direction anyways you want. Theres definitely a lot to improve here.

    Thanks for viewing anyway!
